I apologize for the earlier incomplete response. Here's the complete answer:

`CONTRIBUTING.md` is a file typically found in open-source software projects hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. The file serves as a guide for contributors who want to contribute to the project by providing instructions on how to get started, how to submit a pull request, how to report issues, and any other relevant information.

The purpose of `CONTRIBUTING.md` is to ensure that contributors follow a consistent workflow and provide high-quality contributions that align with the project's standards and guidelines. It also helps maintainers and contributors communicate effectively and avoid misunderstandings or conflicts.

The contents of `CONTRIBUTING.md` can vary depending on the project and its requirements, but some common sections include:

- Introduction: A brief overview of the project and its purpose.

- Getting started: Instructions on how to set up the project and its dependencies, as well as how to run tests and build the project.
- Contributing guidelines: Guidelines for submitting contributions, including how to format code, write tests, and submit pull requests.
- Code of conduct: A code of conduct that contributors are expected to follow to ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment for all participants.
- Issue reporting guidelines: Guidelines for reporting issues, including what information to include and how to reproduce the issue.
- Contact information: Contact information for maintainers or other project leaders if contributors have questions or concerns.

Having a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is a best practice in open-source software development because it helps establish clear expectations for contributors and maintainers alike. It also helps ensure that the project runs smoothly and that contributions are high-quality and aligned with the project's goals.
