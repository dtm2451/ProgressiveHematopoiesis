## Bio Julia Codebook: Testing PyCall and Installation

### Introduction

PyCall is a Julia package that allows you to call Python functions and use Python libraries directly from your Julia code. This can be useful if you need to use a Python library that does not have a Julia equivalent or if you are more familiar with Python. 

In this codebook, we will walk you through the steps to test PyCall and install it on your machine.

### Testing PyCall

Before installing PyCall, you can test it to make sure it is working properly. Here's how:

1. Open Julia REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop).

2. Type `using Pkg; Pkg.add("PyCall")` to install PyCall.

3. Type `using PyCall` to load the PyCall package.

4. Type `pyimport("sys").version` to check the version of Python that PyCall is currently using.

If PyCall is working correctly, you should see the version number of the Python interpreter that it is using.

### Installation

If you have tested PyCall and it is working properly, you can now install it on your machine. Here's how:

1. Open Julia REPL.

2. Type `using Pkg; Pkg.add("PyCall")` to install PyCall.

3. When prompted, type `y` to confirm the installation.

Once the installation is complete, you can start using PyCall to call Python functions and use Python libraries directly from your Julia code.

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully tested PyCall and installed it on your machine. You can now start using PyCall to call Python functions and use Python libraries directly from your Julia code.
